## [Unreleased]

### Enhancements

* Optimized server-side processing of submitted programs.
* The `loda mine` command regularly checks for OEIS updates and regenerates stats. The `mine_parallel.sh` no longer restarts the miners.

## v21.9.21

### Bugfixes

* Fix memory usage statistics on MacOS (Big Sur).

### Features

* Introduced mining modes: local, client and server mode. In the client mode (default), miners automatically submit their findings to a central server. Clients don't need to create pull requests anymore to contribute programs.
* Change maximum memory usage with the setup command.

### Enhancements

* Support for multiple web clients: `curl` (default) and `wget`.
* Migrated environment variable configuration to `loda/setup.txt`.
* Improved messages and usability of the setup command.
* Replace `match` command by extending `mine` with an optional argument.
